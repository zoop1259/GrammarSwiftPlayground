 This playground is designed to be used with the YouTube Series of the same name.  [Go to YouTUBE](https://www.youtube.com/StewartLynch).

 If you hit problems or have questions, you're welcome to tweet me [@StewartLynch](https://twitter.com/StewartLynch) or email <slynch@createchsol.com>.

 - important: This series was inspired by an blog by Antoine van der Lee. [JSON Parsing in Swift explained with Coding Examples](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/json-parsing-decoding/). Antoine kindly gave me permission to follow the flow of explanation in his blog.
 Though I have expanded on his blog, I was taken by his clear explanation and thus resulted in this YouTube series.
